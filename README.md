__Dutchie__ is a command line utility for [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) that helps you maintain a simple, standardized format across all of your commit messages. The [standard](https://github.com/commitizen/conventional-commit-types/blob/master/index.json) is derived from the excellent [Commitizen](https://github.com/commitizen) project.

In addition to providing an easy-to-use CLI for making commits, __Dutchie__ also manages your `CHANGELOG.md` file, so you'll never have to worry about creating and maintaining detailed and accurate release notes again.

# Documentation

## Installation and Setup

Install as a _devDependency_:

```bash
npm install -D dutchie
```

Add the __commit__ and __release__ scripts to your `package.json` file:

```json
{
  "name": "my-project",
  "version": "0.0.1",
  "scripts": {
    "commit": "dutchie --commit",
    "release": "dutchie --release"
  },
}
```

## Making New Commits

When you're ready to commit your changes, your workflow will look something like this:

```bash
# Stage your changes
git add .
```

```bash
# Run Dutchie's guided commit CLI
npm run commit
```

```bash
# Push your changes
git push
```

> __Note:__ Dutchie doesn't make many assumptions about your Git workflow. Other than handling commit messages and managing your changelog, it tries its best to stay out of your way.

## Creating a New Release

The `release` command will automatically create or update your `CHANGELOG.md` file, update the version in your `package.json` file, create a new Git tag for the version, and push all of the changes upstream.

There are only two requirements for creating a release:

1. Have one or more previous commits, ideally using `dutchie --commit`
2. Have no local changes

Once you're ready to create a release, run:

```bash
npm run release
```

If this is your first release, the `CHANGELOG.md` file will be created for you, and the version will be pulled from your `package.json` as is.

For subsequent releases, the version will automatically be bumped based on the types of commits since your last release. If any of the commits contain a feature, the release will be a minor bump (e.g. from 1.0.0 to 1.1.0), otherwise, it will be a patch (e.g. from 1.0.0 to 1.0.1).

To force a major release, use the `--major` argument:

```bash
npm run release -- --major
```

To add this release to GitHub's "releases" feature, use the `--github` argument:

```bash
npm run release -- --github
```

> __Note:__ The `--github` argument will prompt you for your GitHub username and password. This information is never stored, and is only used to make the necessary GitHub API call to create the release. To verify this, I encourage you to view the source code in `lib/release.js`.

# Contributing

__Dutchie__ has a few core goals:

1. Help software teams maintain a detailed yet simple standard across all of their commit messages
2. Help software teams generate a detailed and accurate changelog and release tags for every new version

With these goals in mind, contributions are always welcome.

## Linting

Run ESLint with `npm run lint`.

## Testing

Run unit tests with `npm test`.

# FAQ

### What's with the name?

The [Dutch Shepherd](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dutch_Shepherd) is a relatively uncommon breed of dog that's hard-working, intelligent, and loyal. Often, they're referred to as "Dutchies".

This library aims to do the hard work of intelligently managing your commit messages and changelog without breaking a sweat or complaining. Like the canine, __Dutchie__ aims to be hard-working, intelligent, and loyal.

### Can't I just use Commitizen directly?

Absolutely. If Commitizen and its ecosystem of plugins work for you and your team, by all means, use them.

This library aims to strike a balance between simplicity and detail, and to increase the quality of commit messages and  changelogs by providing a straightforward CLI that developers can become familiar with very rapidly.
